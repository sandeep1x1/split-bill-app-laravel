# Split Bill Development Tasks & Progress

## Phase 1: Project Setup & Core Infrastructure
**Priority:** High | **Estimated Time:** 1-2 hours

### Laravel Setup
- [x] Create new Laravel project `composer create-project laravel/laravel split-bill`
- [x] Set up database connection (.env configuration)
- [x] Install any additional packages (if needed)
- [x] Set up version control (git init, initial commit)

### Database Design & Migrations
- [x] Create bills migration (`php artisan make:migration create_bills_table`)
  - Fields: id, name, created_at, updated_at
- [x] Create friends migration (`php artisan make:migration create_friends_table`)
  - Fields: id, name, bill_id, created_at, updated_at
- [x] Create expenses migration (`php artisan make:migration create_expenses_table`)
  - Fields: id, bill_id, title, amount, paid_by, created_at, updated_at
- [x] Create expense_shares pivot migration (`php artisan make:migration create_expense_shares_table`)
  - Fields: id, expense_id, friend_id, created_at
- [x] Run migrations and verify database structure

### Models & Relationships
- [ ] Create Bill model (`php artisan make:model Bill`)
  - Define hasMany relationship to friends
  - Define hasMany relationship to expenses
- [ ] Create Friend model (`php artisan make:model Friend`)
  - Define belongsTo relationship to bill
  - Define belongsToMany relationship to expenses (through expense_shares)
- [ ] Create Expense model (`php artisan make:model Expense`)
  - Define belongsTo relationship to bill
  - Define belongsTo relationship to friend (paid_by)
  - Define belongsToMany relationship to friends (shared_by)
- [ ] Test relationships in tinker

## Phase 2: Core Functionality
**Priority:** High | **Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours

### Controllers & Routes
- [ ] Create BillController (`php artisan make:controller BillController`)
  - index() - list all bills
  - create() - show create bill form
  - store() - save new bill
  - show() - display single bill with expenses
- [ ] Create ExpenseController (`php artisan make:controller ExpenseController`)
  - store() - add new expense to bill
  - update() - edit existing expense (optional)
  - destroy() - delete expense (optional)
- [ ] Define routes in web.php
  - GET / (dashboard)
  - Resource routes for bills
  - Nested routes for expenses

### Basic Views (Blade Templates)
- [ ] Create layout template (app.blade.php)
  - Include Bootstrap/Tailwind CDN
  - Basic navigation structure
- [ ] Create bills/index.blade.php (dashboard)
  - "Create New Bill" button
  - List existing bills
- [ ] Create bills/create.blade.php
  - Bill name input
  - Dynamic friend addition (JavaScript)
- [ ] Create bills/show.blade.php
  - Bill overview
  - Add expense form
  - List existing expenses

## Phase 3: Business Logic Implementation
**Priority:** High | **Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours

### Calculation Logic
- [ ] Create BillCalculationService class
  - calculateIndividualSpending() - how much each person paid
  - calculateIndividualShares() - how much each person should pay
  - calculateNetBalances() - who owes what
  - generateSettlementPlan() - optimal payment suggestions
- [ ] Test calculation logic with sample data
- [ ] Handle edge cases (zero amounts, single person bills, etc.)

### Form Validation
- [ ] Add validation rules to BillController
  - Bill name required
  - Friends array validation
- [ ] Add validation rules to ExpenseController
  - Title required
  - Amount required, numeric, positive
  - Paid by required, exists in friends
  - Shared by required, array of friend IDs
- [ ] Display validation errors in views

## Phase 4: User Interface & Experience
**Priority:** Medium | **Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours

### Enhanced UI
- [ ] Style all forms with Bootstrap/Tailwind
- [ ] Add JavaScript for dynamic friend addition
- [ ] Implement expense sharing checkboxes functionality
- [ ] Create responsive design
- [ ] Add loading states and user feedback

### Settlement Display
- [ ] Design settlement summary layout
- [ ] Show individual balances clearly
- [ ] Display optimal settlement recommendations
- [ ] Add visual indicators (colors for positive/negative balances)
- [ ] Format currency properly

### Navigation & UX
- [ ] Add breadcrumb navigation
- [ ] Implement back buttons
- [ ] Add confirmation dialogs for delete actions
- [ ] Include helpful text/instructions

## Phase 5: Polish & Testing
**Priority:** Low | **Estimated Time:** 1-2 hours

### Code Quality
- [ ] Add comments to complex calculation logic
- [ ] Refactor controllers (move business logic to services)
- [ ] Follow Laravel naming conventions
- [ ] Clean up unused code and imports

### Testing & Edge Cases
- [ ] Test with various bill scenarios
- [ ] Handle decimal precision for money calculations
- [ ] Test form validation edge cases
- [ ] Verify all relationships work correctly

### Documentation
- [ ] Create README with setup instructions
- [ ] Document AI-assisted vs manual code sections
- [ ] Add inline code comments
- [ ] Create sample data seeder (optional)

## AI Usage Log
*Document what Cursor/AI helped with vs what you implemented manually*

### AI-Assisted Code:
- [ ] Migration boilerplate
- [ ] Model relationship setup
- [ ] Form validation rules
- [ ] Bootstrap/CSS styling
- [ ] JavaScript for dynamic forms

### Manual Implementation:
- [ ] Business logic design
- [ ] Calculation algorithm
- [ ] Database schema decisions
- [ ] User experience flow
- [ ] Settlement optimization logic
